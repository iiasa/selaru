# SELARU modelling framework

Spatially-explicit Energy and LAnd system InfrastRUcture (SELARU) modelling framework is a high-resolution spatially explicit analytical tool for integrated assessments of energy and land systems using Mixed-Integer Linear Programming approach.

SELARU can be used to depict existing or other hypothetical energy and land systems that represent specific policy narratives. Analysis over these various depictions provides quantitative scientific evidence for policy deliberation/recommendations.

The main feature of SELARU is its capability to address economies of scale that occur from geographical expansion of energy and land system infrastructures. This allows a more accurate depiction of long term infrastructure sitting/deployment decisions in a highly complex and geographically diverse environment. For its initial application, SELARU is utilized to investigate various case studies for Indonesia.
